# PowerBI
In this project, I clean the data of the housing market in the US by:
1. Standardize Date Format
2. Populate property Address Data
3. Breaking out Address into Individual Columns (Address, City, State)
4. Change Y and N to Yes and No in 'Sold as Vacant' field
5. Remove Duplicates
6. Delete Unused Columns
